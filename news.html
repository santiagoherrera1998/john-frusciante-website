                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 20
                    years, you’re undoubtedly aware of John Frusciante’s guitar
                    chops. His soaring riffs and triumphant solos were pivotal
                    in elevating the Red Hot Chili Peppers to international
                    stardom and creative triumph, acting as the cerebral
                    complement to Flea’s funky bass and Anthony Kiedis’
                    nonsensical raps. There’s another, woefully-unexplored side
                    to Frusciante aside from his work with the Peppers and as a
                    solo artist, though—for the past 13 years, he’s been
                    moonlighting as the electronic auteur Trickfinger,
                    assembling rave music, ambient, acid, UK garage and more
                    into warped, homespun soundscapes. His third album under
                    that alias, She Smiles Because She Presses The Button,
                    arrived last month on the Acid Test sub-label Avenue 66. It
                    marks the culmination of his journey thus far, his
                    meticulous attention to detail and melody reinterpreted from
                    a digitized standpoint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Frusciante’s introduction to electronic music predates his
                    career arc as a rocker; he first experienced it at age 6,
                    when he heard Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” on the radio. “I
                    was very into New Wave starting when I was 9, and Eno and
                    stuff, but Rave music really started to take off in ’92 when
                    I was beginning a five-year drug run,” Frusciante says. “I
                    had cut myself off from the world and wasn’t paying
                    attention. When I got clean in 1997, I suddenly felt very
                    drawn to anything with synths, drum machines, and breaks,
                    and I started buying as many different kinds of recent
                    electronic music as I could. Some standout discoveries over
                    that next few years were Aphex Twin (Classics), 808 State
                    (Newbuild), Komakino (Energy Trancemission), The Railway
                    Raver (Drop Acid Not Bombs), Autechre (Tri Repetae), The
                    Prodigy (Experience), Squarepusher (Feed Me Weird Things),
                    and C.J. Bolland (The 4th Sign).” Though he’s technically
                    been making electronic music since 1998, it took nearly
                    another ten years for his endeavors to bear fruit. “It
                    wasn’t until 2007, when the first Trickfinger stuff was
                    made, that I found the right gear for me, and was dead set
                    on the path of being my own engineer.”

                    Q: What did you use for the effects in A Doubt? Particularly
                    the higher tone noise in the intro and the whooshing noises
                    at around 2:00. Similarly for the whooshing noises in The
                    Mirror. Synth? Or cymbals with heavy effects? A: Mostly John
                    using his modular synth. It was a huge presence on his
                    records at the time. Unlimited possibilities using that as a
                    processor. He got super creative… Q: What was the odd piano
                    thingy breakdown in Wishing? A: A bunch of music boxes. No I
                    have to correct myself! I think it actually may have been a
                    bunch of piano loops John and Josh made with guitar pedals.
                    Q: What are the main musical and non-musical life lessons
                    you learned from working with John? A: I could write a
                    book!! That man is on another planet from us mere mortals…
                    truly. I just tried to keep up most of the time.

                    John Frusciante was recently interviewed by Tsuyoshi Kizu
                    for Ele-King.net. The interview was posted in Japanese.
                    Below you will find a translation by Google.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For many, even when he left the band, he would have been
                    “Red Hot Chili Peppers (RHCP) John Frusciante”, and he’s
                    known to be the band’s greatest masterpiece,
                    “Californication.” He would have been a guitarist who
                    brought lyricism. That’s why the news about the return to
                    the band, which was announced the other day, was
                    enthusiastically received by old fans, and as a member of
                    the stadium band, I want to see him playing the guitar
                    again.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But the listener, who has been following his solo career,
                    knows that Frusciante is a great electronic music maker. In
                    the past solo works, he sometimes introduced electronic
                    elements to guitar music, but since he used the name
                    Trickfinger, he concentrates on pure electronic music such
                    as Acid House and IDM. His machine music isn’t new, but it’s
                    very neat, and the lyrical spilling from it is so tasty.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    His album “She Smiles Because She Presses The Button”, which
                    is the first Trickfinger in three years, also shows his
                    strengths well. There is an IDM like early outing, there are
                    tracks with jungle elements popping out along the way, and
                    there is a melodious acid house. You can hear that each of
                    them is very carefully made. Rhythm patterns and detailed
                    arrangements of sounds are more sophisticated than they have
                    ever been, and as I say, they are the result of constant
                    efforts. As a guitarist and producer of electronic music,
                    his overly stoic attitude has created his personality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even so, academic considerations for the maniac Good and
                    music to the machine, not stop and speaks while the …… etc
                    affection (especially endless respect for Autechre) to the
                    electronic music, is exhibited his charming music geek first
                    time It became an interview. As you can see in the text,
                    after this work, there is also a solo album (according to
                    himself) that is closer to the jungle, so I would like to
                    look forward to not only RHCP activities but also those.

                    now and then but for now, all shows that were scheduled for
                    John every fourth Saturday of the month are cancelled. That
                    includes the show that was scheduled for this Saturday.
